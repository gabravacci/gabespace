Hello, I'm Gabriel Ravacci, a 3rd year student of Engineering Physics at UBC. I'm passionate about math, physics and hardware! I'll be joining AMD as a Firmware Engineering Intern this fall. I am also researching neural network inference through AIE hardware blocks (with the AMD Versal chip) for my senior year engineering project.
